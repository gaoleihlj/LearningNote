MATLAB 中包括 Optimization 和 Global Optimization两个优化工具箱
其中 Optimization 的描述为:

Optimization Toolbox™ provides functions for finding parameters that minimize or maximize objectives while satisfying constraints. The toolbox includes solvers for linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming, quadratic programming, nonlinear optimization, and nonlinear least squares.  You can use these solvers to find optimal solutions to continuous and discrete problems, perform tradeoff analyses, and incorporate optimization methods into algorithms and applications.

Key Features
#### Nonlinear and multiobjective optimization
#### Solvers for nonlinear least squares, data fitting, and nonlinear equations
#### Quadratic and linear programming
#### Mixed-integer linear programming
#### Optimization app for defining and solving optimization problems and monitoring solution progress
#### Acceleration of constrained nonlinear solvers with Parallel Computing Toolbox™
